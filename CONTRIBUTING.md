# Contributing Guidelines

## Contributions we're after

The current user requirements are somewhat simple and leave no guidelines for future development.
Therefore, the next step required in development would be to undergo some user requirement elicitation,
to establish a more clear direction and continuation for the project. Other contributions include:

- Reporting bugs
- Submitting fixes for bugs
- Suggesting new features
- Maintaining the current codebase

## Getting started

To begin check to see if there are any open issues, in which case, check for issues labeled with "good first issue"
and try to complete them. after you have already contributed to the project, or there are no issues with the 
"good first issue" tag, you are free to complete any of the other available issues.
