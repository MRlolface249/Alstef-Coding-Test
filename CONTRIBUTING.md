# Contributing Guidelines

## Contributions we're after

The current user requirements are somewhat simple and leave no guidelines for future development.
Therefore, the next step required in development would be to undergo some user requirement elicitation,
to establish a more clear direction and continuation for the project. Other contributions include:

- Reporting bugs
- Submitting fixes for bugs
- Suggesting new features
- Maintaining the current codebase

## Getting started

To begin check to see if there are any open issues, in which case, check for issues labeled with "good first issue"
and try to complete them. after you have already contributed to the project, or there are no issues with the 
"good first issue" tag, you are free to complete any of the other available issues.

## How to file a bug report, or suggest a new feature

In this project we use GitHub issues to track bugs and features. If you have found a bug or have a feature request,
please open an issue using the appropriate template. The bug report template can be found here: https://github.com/MRlolface249/Alstef-Coding-Test/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md
with a very intuitive and descriptive outline given for you to fill in. Similarly, the feature request template can be found here: https://github.com/MRlolface249/Alstef-Coding-Test/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.md
with a similar outline to the bug report template.

## Pull Requests

GitHub is used to host the code of this project, track features requests and bug reports, and for creating and accepting pull requests as well. To propose any changes to the most recent version of the codebase, we welcome you to make a pull request, provided you follow the steps outlined below:

1. Clone the main project repository, and create your branch from the main branch. The branch should have a descriptive name starting with your GitHub username followed by a description of the feature you're working on, or bug you're fixing.
2. Update your local repository with the most recent code from the main repository. Remember to rebase often – don’t wait until all changes have been made.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests. As well as this, run all existing tests to make sure the application works as expected
4. For any breaking changes update the documentation to explain the change.
5. **Create a pull request**, ensuring that the title summarises the changes made. In the body, reference the associated issue, as well as providing further details about the changes made to the project.
6. Another member of the team will review the pull request, leaving a comment on whether it should be merged, or whether changes need to be made.
7. If the pull request is approved, you may merge the branch into the main branch.
