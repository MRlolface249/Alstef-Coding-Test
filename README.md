# Alstef-Coding-Test

## Functionality

2. Read the previous number that was written to disk by the program the previous time it ran
3. Add the entered number to the previous number. This will give you a total number
4. If the total number is greater than 152 then subtract 152 from the total number
5. Display the total number to the user
6. Save the total number to disk
7. Exit
